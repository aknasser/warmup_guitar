# warmup_guitar
A tiny app to learn the guitar notes from the neck to the 12th fret...let's rock!


# What the project does
Every X seconds, the app displays randomly a note to play (for instance Bb) on a given chord (for instance the 5th chord)
X : number of seconds to find the note on your guitar and play it. This value can be changed by the user.


# Why the project is useful
The guitar is a cool instrument but it's not as easy as it seems. 
To build good foundations as a guitarist, it's important to know the notes on your Guitar from the neck to the 12th fret.
A good guitarist must be able to find any notes on any chords at a moment's notice. This knowledge is the key to play solo and master this wonderful instrument.
With this app, I provide an interface to learn these notes in a funny way (learning them by heart and sheer repetition can be boring,right ?)
